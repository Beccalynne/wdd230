Cookies send information about you with the random ID, preferences or log ins, adds, meant to be user helpful
Even if you clear cookies they are still stored online and will reload on your device */

/* Local storage is on users website but never transfered back and forth
Nice for settings of the user, using key value pairs
doesn't expire or unless cleared */

/* Sesion storage acts like local storage
Expires each time the tab is closed, refreshing the page it will stay */
